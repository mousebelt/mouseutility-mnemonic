#MouseUtils Mnemonic

This is a mnemonic and address generation utility from MouseBelt. You can clone and run it locally with the following commands:

#### Installation

```
npm install
npm start
```


Currently, you can paste in a seed and derive addresses and private keys. Some of the addresses optionally feature xpub keys for HD style wallets. This allows you to check mnemonic-style derivations across multiple blockchains.
